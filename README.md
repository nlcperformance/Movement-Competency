# Movement-Competency
Client checklist to see what level each client is with regards to their movements in multiple areas. 
The "R.A.G.E." system provides a clear, color-coded framework for assessing movement quality. Here's a quick recap of the levels:
ðŸ”´ Red (Restricted): Indicates pain, poor mechanics, or failure to perform even regressed versions of the movement. This requires immediate attention and a focus on mobility and skill acquisition before adding any significant load.
ðŸŸ¡ Amber (Asymmetrical / In Progress): Represents partial range of motion, mild imbalances, or some instability. These movements require targeted coaching cues and supportive exercises.
ðŸŸ¢ Green (Good / Functional): The client demonstrates solid form, no pain, and balanced movement. These exercises are safe and effective for regular inclusion in their training program.
âš« Elite (Explosive / Loaded Proficiency): Signifies mastery of the movement, allowing for the addition of significant load, explosive power, tempo variations, or increased complexity.
